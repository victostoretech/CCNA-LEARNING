# TCP/IP MODEL
* The layers in the 5 layer model:
 - Application layer(7): Defines how application proesses formats,sends and interpretes data(HTTP,FTP,TFTP,)
 - Transport layer(L4): Provides communiction between application processes using port numbers(Protocols: TCP,UDP)
 - Network layer(Internet layer)(L3):Provides end to end delivery between host accross networks using Ip address (Protocols:IPV4&6,ICMP.  Devices:Routers,L3 switches)
 - Data link layer (Local network layer)(L2): Provides hop to hop delivery of message on a local area network using MAC addresses(swictches,bridges) 
 - Physical layer(L1): Sends and receoives bits as electrical,optical,radio signal through physical medium(Cables,NIC,connectors,antennas)

  Application layer(7)
  Prensation layer(6)
  Session Layer(5)
  Transport layer(L4)
  Network layer(Internet layer)(L3)
  Data link layer (Local network layer)(L2)
  Physical layer(L1)
* Protocols & Standards
- Protocols : A set of rules defining how data is communicated between devoices on a network.
- Standards: An agreed upon specifiction that describes how protocol or technology should work.

Independent standard organizations like IEEE and IETF defines standards
- IEE defines many standardss used on LAN e.g Ethernet, WIFI
- IETF(internet Engineering task force) defines protocols used in the internet and publishes standards in document known as RFCs(Request for comments)

*Encapsulation & Decapsulation
This involves adding/removing headers to the data as it moves up/down the layers.
L2 adds trailers which is used by the receiving device for transmission error check.

*adjascent & same layer interaction
 adjascent layer interaction is the Interaction betweeen each layer(providing service to layer above or being serviced by layer below)
 same layer interaction is an interaction or communiction between the same layer on different device. e.g communication btw L1 on device A and L1 on device B

* PDUs(Protocol Data Unit)
L7PDU=Data
L4PDU= segment(for TCP) and datagram( for UDP)
L3PDU= packet
L2PDU= frame

the main content of the PDU is called Payload.
Segmet payload = Data from the application
packet payload = segment
Frame payload = packet
